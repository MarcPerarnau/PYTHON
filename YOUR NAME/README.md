# YOUR NAME
Write a program that prompts for the user's full name on the console and then displays the user's full name three times, once with all lowercase letters, once with all uppercase letters, and once with only the first letter of the first name and last name in uppercase. The user can enter his or her name in any combination of upper and lower case letters.
