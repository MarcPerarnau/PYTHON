# TOY STORE
A toy store is very successful in two of its products: clowns and dolls. They usually do mail order and the logistics company charges them by weight of each package so they have to calculate the weight of the clowns and dolls that will go out in each package on demand. Each clown weighs 112 g and each doll weighs 75 g. Write a program that reads the number of clowns and dolls sold in the last order and calculates the total weight of the package that will be shipped.
